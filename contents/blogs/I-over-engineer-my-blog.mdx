Welcome to the first post in the my digital blog. If you are reading this, I am really grateful that you are spending time on visiting my website. Now let the journey begins then.

# Trying NextJS for the first time

I heard from lots of people that I should give [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) a try if I love ReactJS and to be 
honest, NextJS lives up to the hype and I actually love it (currently). So let see what 
are the problems that NextJS trying to resolve for React developer:  

* When using React, there is a huge chance that you have to write some server-side logic to connect
you React app to the database.

* You do not want your app depends entirely on browser to compile everything, instead you want to ship as little JavaScript code as possible
to speed up rendering process

* Dealing with SEO in React is quite painful because React is **client-side** rendering that means some of
contents will be missed from search engine bots because on initial page load HTML will be served with little
or even no content until you are able to fetch the JavaScript. So you may want to **pre-render** some pages for performance
and SEO making you want to use **server-side** rendering **( because your top priority is that the content and metadata is available first
on page)** instead of client-side.


This is some of the huge advantage from NextJS that I'm experiencing so far:  

* Providing you a nice **routing system** (literally based on your folder structure without any configuration) 
* Pre-rendering all page content, providing both static-site-generation (SSG) as well as server-site-generation
(SSR) at the same time
* Supporting Built-in CSS, Sass and pre-optimized Image on the page 
* Also providing API routing system for building API endpoints

# Trying MDX for the first time

If you are a developer, [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)(MD) is not something that unfamiliar to you. I myself use [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) 
everyday to take notes which are rendered in Markdown format. If you knows about Markdown, you can tell that the way 
everything got rendered (from heading, to link tag, img,...) is just similar to HTML format and in fact, you are actually
able to transfer a Markdown file into a website by using some framework out there and MDX is one of them.
<br/>
What is so special about [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)? It allows you to use JSX, import your own components, and even custom everything in your own ways.  
<br/>
Let take a quick example:

```markdown
## This is the first example

Because I feel *bored* so I created **this** website to get myself out of the lazy

New things that I want to learn in 2022:
* Learn more about [hardware](https://example.com) stuffs
* Improve my `competitive` [programming](https://example.com) skills
* Learning more about *networking*

```

Translate to an HTML page:


```markup
<h2> This is the first example</h2>
<p>Because I feel <em>bored</em> so I created <strong>this</strong> website to get myself out of the lazy</p>

<hr/>
<p>New things that I want to learn in 2022:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn more about <a href="https://example.com">hardware</a> stuffs</li>
    <li>Improve my <code>competitive</code> <a href="https://example.com">programming</a>] skills</li>
    <li>Learning more about <code>networking</code></li>
</ul>

A <img src="./image.png" alt="funny image here"/>
```
To be honest, If you are like me (using MD frequently) translate it to HTML is quite easy. But let ask
your friends, or someone who don't usually doing web dev much, which version is more readable?
In fact, if you tell your friends, who know nothing about MD, try to learn some basic features, they can 
write the whole blog for you.
<br/>

I will guide you to create and custom a beautiful page with MDX in my next post. 

# Trying ChakraUI for the fisrt time

CSS Framework is quite similar to each other.
[ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) is components css framework which basically means that
they provide you some components, you understand each components by seeing the docs and follow their rules. There are some nice things
about ChakraUI like being able to quickly create custom components, get function for switching between light-mode and dark-mode. 
I will give you some more in depth [comparison](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/comparison) here.

# Summary
Will I recommend you to follow this stacks that I am using currently? Not quite. Blog should be light-weight and easy to maintain for a long term.
You don't need to use a lot of tools at the same time just to create some information on the Internet and later on, you don't want to keep updating
your packages that may break your current components on the website. 
<br/>
But a lots of developers from what I saw always over-engineer their website anyway. I try these new lib/framework out just for learning and having new experience.
