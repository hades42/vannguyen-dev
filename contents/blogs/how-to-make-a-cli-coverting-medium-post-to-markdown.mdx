For someone who just read my blog by accident, I'm using a note-taking app called [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) to take note which requires me 
to write every thing in markdown format and I get used to that. So one day I feel bored and came up with an idea that turning Medium posts (of course
not include premium post) into a markdown format since Medium a big platform for blogger and it is going to be easier for me to take note since now I just
put every thing into Joplin.

# Prerequisites

If you have not done any NodeJS CLI before, there is a really good [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2h28p4s-Xs) on Internet from Twilio. Please
watch the first 5min, it is not that long and highly recommend watching the whole video and try out some stuff.
<br></br>
There is some package that we need to install:

* [esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm) This is a **requirement** package since it will help to support ESM feature like dynamic import
* [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) This is a **requirement** package since it will allow to use Fetch API
* [turndown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turndown) This is a **requirement** package since it will allow us to translate markup into markdown

```markdown
<h1>The title</h1> --> # The title
```
* [ora](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ora) This is **optional** package since it just create some spinner animation when we fetch the API.

# Big Problem

There are multiple approach to get this project done. One of the is doing Web Scrapping to get the main content of the website since this is just a beginner guide, so
I will make the Web scrapping method in another post.   

<br/>

The other method is using [Medium API](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs) to get the content. Unfortunately, the Medium does not provide the content of the 
post. But they do publish one thing that we can take advantage of, which is their [RSS feeds](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-RSS-feeds) (there is
also a big drawback from using RSS feeds, which is that Medium only provide that latest 10 posts for us).

<br/>

Then using an API called [rss2json](https://rss2json.com/#rss_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Frss) to help convert RSS format into JSON format so it is going
to be way easier to work with.

# The main logic

```
First we want to get the URL from args
-> then we get the proper link from the URL to construct RSS URL https://medium.com/feed/<User name>.
--> Fetching the Feed and give the Feed to rss2json API.
---> Getting the JSON data from the rss2json (Now you can do whatever your want since JSON data is really easy to work with). 
----> Using 'turndown' to convert the main content into makrdown format.
-----> Put the data some where.
```

# Let's code

Let's call the project **m2m** (which stands for medium to markdown)

<br/>

If you follow the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites), make sure to watch Twilio tutorial as well as install the necessary packages.

<br/>

There are some files that are important for initial setup

```JSON file=package.json
{
    "name": "<Put your name here>/m2m",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "A CLI to translate medium post into markdown format",
    "main": "src/cli.js",
    // The "bin" will define how the script gonna be called
    "bin": {
        "<Put your name her >/m2m": "bin/m2m",
        "m2m": "bin/m2m"
    },
    "publishConfig": {
        "access": "public"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [
        "cli",
        "m2m"
    ],
    "author": "Van Nguyen Nguye",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dependencies": {
        "esm": "^3.2.25",
        "node-fetch": "^2.6.7",
        "ora": "^5.4.1",
        "turndown": "^7.1.1"
    }
}
```

```javascript file=bin/m2m
#!/usr/bin/env node
// The first line starting with #! is called a shebang which is used to specify the absolute path to the interpreter
// that will run the code below
require = require("esm")(module /* , options */);
require("../src/cli.js").cli(process.argv);
```

```javascript file=src/cli.js
export function cli(args) {
    // by default when you type "m2m" there are 2 thing gonna be return from args
    // First arg is Node in your computer
    // Second is the entry point of your code (which is bin/m2m)
    // And the rest is every thing you type in
    console.log(args);
}
```

Do not forget to run `npm link` to create a symlink to our code. More on [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link)

## First step: construct the RSS URL and Get JSON data

There is one thing that we have to worry about:
* https://blog.craftz.dog/what-i-accomplished-in-2021-my-challenge-for-2022-dc8b025f0132
* https://medium.com/odoruinu/what-i-accomplished-in-2021-my-challenge-for-2022-dc8b025f0132

Both links above are the same content from the same person but, the link is totally different? Why is that? Turn out
Medium allow you to create a seperate blog (like for a community or a company, organisation,...). So there will be 2 different RSS links respectively:

* https://blog.craftz.dog/feed
* https://medium.com/feed/odoruinu

```javascript file=src/cli.js
export function cli(args) {
    // We get the URL
    const myArgs = args.slice(2);
    // This will container the ID of the pager(this is the title of the page)
    let mainID;

    // Split every thing by the '/'
    const processedURL = (URL) => {
        return URL.split("/");
    };

    const fetchURL = async (URL) => {
        const currURL = processedURL(URL);
        // Check to see whether the link is a personal blog and community blog
        const found = currURL.findIndex((el) => el === "medium.com");
        // Create appropriate RSS feed link

        let feedURL =
            found > -1
                ? `${currURL[0]}//${currURL[2]}/feed/${currURL[3]}`
                : `${currURL[0]}//${currURL[2]}/feed`;

        // Assign the mainID of the post
        mainID = found > -1 ? currURL[4] : currURL[3];

        // After having RSS feed, using rss2json to fetch for JSON data
        const getJSONFormat = await fetch(
            `https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=${feedURL}`
        );

        // Parse to JSON and return it
        const text = await getJSONFormat.text();
        const json = JSON.parse(text);
        return json;
    };
}
```

## Second Step: Turn every thing into Markdown

Highly recommend you to take one of the RSS feed I provided above and put to [rss2json](https://rss2json.com/#rss_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Frss)
to see what is the structure of data we get back from the API. 

<br/>

Currently, it is going to be similar to this structure

```API-structure
{
    // we can ignore these attributes
    "status": "..."
    "feed": {
        ...
    }

    // This is what we want, the "items" attribute will be an array of object that represent the information of each post
    // We basically want to take out the "items" value
    "items": [
        // This is one post
        {
            "title": "...",
            "pubDate": "...",
            "link": "..."
            "author": "..."
            ...
        },
        // And other posts
        ...
    ]
}
```

```javascript file=src/cli.js 
// Async function becasue we did fetch data from function above
    const convertToMD = async () => {
        // Fetch the JSON content 
        const feed = await fetchURL(myArgs[0]);
        let mainContent;
        let flag = false;

        // We checking for every post in the RSS feed, whether there is any ID similar to the URL we need
        for (const item of feed.items) {
            // Since the URL in RSS has some query in the link, we need to remove those to get the actual ID
            const processLink = processedURL(item.link.split("?")[0]);
            for (const li of processLink) {
                // Find the matching ID
                if (li === mainID) {
                    mainContent = item;
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return a new Promise
        return new Promise((resolve, rejects) => {
            // If we could not find anything, that's probably a premium post or the post from long time ago (I mentioned in Big Problem section)
            if (!flag) {
                rejects("This is a preimum post!");
            } else {
                // If there is a match
                const turndownService = new TurndownService();
                // Convert the whole HTML content into markdown by using turndown
                const markdownContent = turndownService.turndown(
                    mainContent.content
                );
                // Create frontmatter
                const frontmatter = `
---
firstPublishedAt: ${mainContent.pubDate}
slug: ${mainContent.link}
thumbnail: ${mainContent.thumbnail}
author: ${mainContent.author} 
title: ${mainContent.title}
tags: [${mainContent.categories}]
---\n\n`;
                // Merge them together
                resolve(frontmatter + markdownContent);
            }
        });
    };
```

## Final Step: Find somewhere to put the content
The final step is an entry point to bring everything together

```javascript file=src/cli.js
    // The main function is also the entry point of our CLI
    const main = async () => {
        // If we have more than 2 arg or only m2m, we gonna print the usuage of our CLI 
        if (myArgs.length < 1 || myArgs.length > 2) {
            console.log("Usage: m2m <Medium_URL>");
            process.exit(1);
        }
        // Create a spinner with ora
        const spinners = ora("Converting File\n").start();
        // Since we return a promise, if the promise get reject, we will just print the error
        const content = await convertToMD().catch((error) => {
            spinners.fail(error);
            exit(1);
        });
        // If the promise get resolve, we will create a /posts to container all the file
        const currDir = process.cwd() + "/posts";

        //Create a /posts folder at current Dir
        try {
            if (!fs.existsSync(currDir)) {
                fs.mkdirSync(currDir);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            spinners.fail(error);
        }

        // write to the file
        const fileName = mainID + ".md";
        fs.writeFileSync(`${currDir}/${fileName}`, content, (err) => {
            spinners.fail(err);
        });

        spinners.succeed("Successfully create .md file");
    };

    // Run the main function of our CLI
    main();
```
